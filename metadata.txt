about=This script measures similarity between 2 line geometries, independently of translation, scale or rotation. Lines are standardised, by creating for each line an array with 2 columns and 1 line for each vertex except first and last : - 1 column for the vertex position between 0 and 1, 0 corresponding to the first vertex and 1 to the last vertex - the angle between the vertex, the previous vertex and the next one The 2 arrays are then considered as variables and the spearman correlation coefficient is calculated. Input : 2 lines layers loaded in QGIS, with only 1 line entity in each layer Output : spearman correlation coefficient and p-value, + plot for the standardized lines
