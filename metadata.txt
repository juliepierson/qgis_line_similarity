about=This script measures shape similarity between line geometries 2-by-2, independently of translation, scale or rotation.
It takes 2 line layers as input, and their id field. Lines from each layer with same id get compared, and similarity measures using different statistical tests are computed.
Output is a CSV with the statistical results and p-values.
Statistical tests used are Spearman, Student and Wilcoxon. Thanks to Gr√©goire Le Campion (UMR Passages, CNRS) for his input on statistics !
This plugin is added in processing, in a provider called "shape analysis".
